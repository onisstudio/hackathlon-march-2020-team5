                        be professionally employed as an electrical engineer in the United States,[1] and the first
                        female professor of electrical engineering in the country.[2] She was the first woman to deliver
                        a paper at the American Institute of Electrical Engineers, the first female engineer whose
                        professional standing was recognized by Tau Beta Pi, and the first woman named as a Fellow of
                        the American Institute of Electrical Engineers. She specialized in electrical power system
                        analysis[3] and wrote Circuit Analysis of A-C Power Systems.[4]

                    <li>Clarke started her career as a human computer, supporting the engineers working to build the first transcontinental phone line.</li>
                    <li>She is most famous for the “Clarke Calculator” in 1921. A graphical device that simplified understand power lines equations.</li>
                    <li>Clarke helped build the Hoover Dam, developing and installing the turbines that generate hydropower there to this day.</li>
                    <li>Clarke used analyzers to gather data about the electric grid, an innovative idea at the time that can be seen as the first step towards “smart grid” technology.</li>
                    <li>In 2015 she was inducted into the Inventors Hall of Fame, joining Thomas Edison and Nikola Tesla, for her invention of the Clarke Calculator.</li>
